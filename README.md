# The You are Atman project
Purpose of this project is to enable spiritual aspirants on the Yoga path to track their daily spiritual work, as well as to note down any incidents that occurred throughout the course of the day, thus promoting vigilance, introspection and self-analysis.

It is based on the Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali, where it exposes the first two Yoga limbs. It provides the oportunity to the aspirant to note down, whether on a particular day he or she managed to follow all Yamas (moral imperatives) and Niyamas (virtuous habits, behaviors and observances); as well to describe particular obstacles (Antarayah) and possible correlates (Sahabhuva) that have manifested during the course of the day.
